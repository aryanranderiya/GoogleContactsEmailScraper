# Google Contacts Email Scraper

- Use the Google People's (Contacts) API to fetch email addresses from a large contacts directory and from personal contacts & write them to txt files.
- Use case: Scrape all emails from a University Contacts directory and export them to a txt file.
- Google Contacts does not have a native Bulk Contact Export feature that exports all contacts at once. This provides a way to do so.
- You can customise this script to store names, phone numbers and more. [Read more.](https://developers.google.com/people/api)

## Usage

> Make sure to setup a Project using Google Cloud Console. <br>
> More Information Here: https://developers.google.com/people/v1/getting-started

- The Script should work fine out of the box if a project is setup correctly using OAuth 2.0 with the following scopes: `contacts.readonly` & `directory.readonly` in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

- After running the script using `python app.py` it will redirect to complete the authentication procses, after which a `token.json` file be created in the same directory.

- After scraping all the emails, the txt files containing the emails will be stored in the same directory in `contacts_emails.txt` and `directory_emails_alphabetic.txt` `directory_emails_domain.txt` if your account is under an organization (such as a University domain: studentusername@university.edu.in)
